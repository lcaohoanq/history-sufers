**For complete Docker deployment instructions, see [DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md)**

### Docker Hub

Pre-built images are available on Docker Hub:

- **Latest**: `docker pull lcaohoanq/boxy-run:latest`
- **Versioned**: `docker pull lcaohoanq/boxy-run:v2.0.0`

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the server settings using environment variables:

### Maximum Players Per Room

Control how many players can join a single race room:

```bash
# Using .env file (recommended)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set MAX_PLAYERS=50

# Or set directly when starting
MAX_PLAYERS=100 npm start
```

**Examples:**

- `MAX_PLAYERS=10` - Small intimate races
- `MAX_PLAYERS=25` - Medium sized competitions
- `MAX_PLAYERS=50` - Default, large races
- `MAX_PLAYERS=100` - Massive multiplayer events

### Player Color System

The game automatically assigns unique colors to each player:

- **Players 1-25:** Predefined carefully selected color palette
- **Players 26+:** Dynamically generated using HSL golden angle distribution
- Each player gets a visually distinct color, even in 100+ player rooms

### Player Avatars

Each player gets a unique avatar automatically generated using the [Dicebear Adventurer API](https://www.dicebear.com/):

- **Deterministic:** Same name always generates the same avatar
- **Unique:** Different names create visually distinct characters
- **Persistent:** Avatar appears in lobby, room browser, and race leaderboard
- **No Storage:** Avatars are generated on-the-fly via API (no image hosting needed)

Example: A player named "Alex" will always have the same adventurer avatar across all rooms and sessions.

### Notification System

All game events trigger toast notifications:

- 🟢 **Success** (green): Tạo phòng thành công, race started, player ready
- 🔴 **Error** (red): Room full, invalid code, connection issues
